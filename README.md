# quiz-app
Basic Functioning Quiz that allows the user to take a pre-set quiz and get a grade for it as well as retake it. 
Lots of CSS due to allowing for mobile compatibility, otherwise mostly JavaScript 
as the buttons (and their functionality), answer choices, questions, grade alert, and changing of pages are all in JavaScript.
